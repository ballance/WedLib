# WedLib

## Intro
This morning my wife asked me to fix our printer so that she could print out these MadLib style forms for a bachelorette party activity.  I hate printers, seriously they stab at my soul, so I decided to automate the process instead.  This is the result.

## Technologies
 - HTML
 - jQuery (I was in a hurry, this could easily be removed)
 - Node.js
 - Node modules
    - connect
    - serve-static

## Description
WedLib is a flavor of the MadLib write-your-own-story books you might remember from when you were a kid.  It is specific to a single story for now, but could be updated with a generator to work with any number of stories.

## Todo.txt
 - Build a custom generator tool
 - Add persistence for generated WedLib stories
 - Add ability to send your WedLib story to yourself or someone else
 - Unit tests
 - Remove jQuery dependency
